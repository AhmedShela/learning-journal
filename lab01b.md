# Growth Mindset
Scholars are deeply gratified when their ideas catch on. And they are even more gratified when their ideas make a difference — improving motivation, innovation, or productivity, for example. But popularity has a price: people sometimes distort ideas, and therefore fail to reap their benefits. This has started to happen with my research on “growth” versus “fixed” mindsets among individuals and within organizations.
## some reminder to me to stay growth mindest:
1. No *Pain* No *Gain*
1. Keep Trying
1. **never Give Up**
