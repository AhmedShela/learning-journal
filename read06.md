# What make Computer a comuter

First of all computers make 4 major tasks
they take **inputs** and **Store** information , **process** it
then **output** the results.

so any machine that able to achive this process can be called a **Computer**

## Input:
input is the stuff thast the you do to tell what the computer does

## Storing & Processing:
all this input stored in memory then a computer processor tace info from memory
change it using algorithms which is a series of commands
then send this proccesed input back to be stored again in the memory.

# output:

a computer display can show text,photos,vidios,games even virtual reallity.

and in case of a netweks, an output of a computer can be the input of another and vise versa

# machine language:
every body heard that the computers works on **1's** and **0's**.
well theat is right because actually the computers in all about electronic circels
that means if this electric is passing through the wire that means it is on or
in machine language it is **1** else it is a **0**.
