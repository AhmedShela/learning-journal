# HTML

Hyper Text Marckup Language
html descripe the structure of the web page as following 

`<html> <body>  `
`<h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>  `
`<p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of     the page. And if the page is a long one it might     be split up into several sub-headings.`
`</p>  `
`<h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>  `
`<p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help     you follow the structure of what is being written.     There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level     headings).</p>  `
`<h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>  `
`<p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p> `
`</body> `
`</html>`

#### `<body>`
You met the `<body>` element in the first example we created. Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window. 
`<head>`
Before the `<body>` element you will often see a `<head>` element. This contains information about the page (rather than information that is shown within the main part of the browser window that is highlighted in blue on the opposite page). You will usually find a `<title>` element inside the `<head>` element. 
`<title>`
The contents of the `<title>` element are either shown in the top of the browser, above where you usually type in the URL of the page you want to visit, or on the tab for that page (if your browser uses tabs to allow you to view multiple pages at the same time).

Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using (although browsers usually display the page even if it is not included). We will therefore be including one in each example for the rest of the book.
As you will see when we come to look at CSS and its box model on page 316, the use of a DOCTYPE can also help the browser to render a page correctly.
Because XHTML was written in XML, you will sometimes see pages that use the XHTML strict DOCTYPE start with the optional XML declaration. Where this is used, it should be the first thing in a document. There must be nothing before it, not even a space.

`<!-- -->`
If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these characters:
`<!-- comment goes here -->`

Your content and design should be influenced by the goals of your users. 
To help determine why people are coming to your website, there are two basic categories of questions you can ask:
1: The first attempts to discover the underlying motivations for why visitors come to the site.
2: The second examines the specific goals of the visitors. These are the triggers making them come to the site now


you must list every reson why anyone wants to visit your website


content
Web pages often have a lot of information to communicate. For example, the pages of online newspapers will have information that does not appear on every page of the print equivalent:
* A masthead or logo 
* Links to navigate the site 
* Links to related content and  
* other popular articles
* Login or membership options 
* Ability for users to comment 
* Copyright information 
* Links to privacy policies,  
* terms and conditions, advertising information, RSS feeds, subscription options



### Prioritizing
If everything on a page appeared in the same style, it would be much harder to understand. (Key messages would not stand out.)
By making parts of the page look distinct from surrounding content, designers draw attention to (or away from) those items.
Designers create something known as a visual hierarchy to help users focus on the key messages that will draw people's attention, and then guide them to subsequent messages.

### organizing
Grouping together related content into blocks or chunks makes the page look simpler (and easier to understand). 
Users should be able to identify the purpose of each block without processing each individual item.
By presenting certain types of information in a similar visual style (such as using the same style for all buttons or all links), users will learn to associate that style with a particular type of content.
